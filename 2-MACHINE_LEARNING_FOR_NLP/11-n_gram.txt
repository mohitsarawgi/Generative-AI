  # N gram

  s1 -> the food is good
  s2 -> the food is not good

  vocabulary after removing stop words -> 

       food     not    good
  s1    1        0       1
  s2    1        1       1

# we will take combination of 2 words - bigram, 3 words - trigram

            
             vocabulary + bigram

                 food    not    good    food not   food good   not good
         s1       1       0       1          0          1         0
         s2       1       1       1          1          1         1

 * Now the vectors have huge difference...
