#   Advantages                 Disadvantages

1) simple and intuative      1) Sparse matrix (large size matrix) overfitting
2) Fixed vector i/p          2) Ordering of word is changing, (based on frequency), therefore meaning is also changing
                             3) cannot add new word, (out of vocabulary)
                             4) semantic meaning is still not getting captured


                            The food is good
                            The food is not good

                            vector = s1 [1 1 1 0 1]
                                     s2 [1 1 1 1 1] 

                                     matrix is very similar 
                                     even both have very different meaning

                                    *The graph should not be similar...
