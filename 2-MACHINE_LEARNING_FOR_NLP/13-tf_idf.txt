# ITF-IDF - TERF FREQUENCY AND INVERSE DOCUMENT FREQUENCY


   TERM FREQ = no. of rep of words in sentence / no. of words in sentence
   
   IDF   = log (No. of sentence / no. of sentences containing the word)


   s1 - good boy
   s2 - good girl
   s3 - boy girl good


TERM FREQUENCY - no. of rep of words in sentence / no. of words in sentence

         s1    s2     s3

good    1/2    1/2    1/3

boy     1/2    0      1/3

girl     0     1/2    1/3



IDF - log (No. of sentence / no. of sentences containing the word)

words        IDF

good        loge(3/3) = 0

boy         loge(3/2) 

girl        loge(3/2)




TF-IDF ---- TF * IDF


         good                boy                girl

 s1    1/2*loge(3/3)=0     1/2*loge(3/2)       0*loge(3/2)=0

 s2    1/2*loge(3/3)=0       0*loge(3/2)=0      1/2*loge(3/2)

 s3    1/3*loge(3/3)=0     1/3*loge(3/2)      1/3*loge(3/2) 

good = less importance - because it was present in all sentences...



   # Advantage                              Disadvantage

1 Intuative                              Sparcity still exists
2 fixed size -> vocab size               still out of vocabulary
3 word importance is getting captured 

(if a word present in all sentence then it was given LESS importance)
