 Word2Vec -> It uses a neural network model to learn word association
             from a large corpus of text.
             Once trained, such model can detect synonymous words
             or suggest additional words for partial sentence.
             As the name implies, word2vec represents each distinct 
             word with a particular list numbers called vectors.

      Each word in a vocabulary will be converted into a
      feature representation..

                     Boy    Girl   King    Queen     Apple     Orange
                     
Such as - Gender     -1      1     -0.92   0.96       0.001     0.002
          Royal      0.01
          Age        062      ...
          Food
          ....

          * -1 , +1 -> represents opposite gender..


          King - Boy + Queen = Girl


* Cosine Similarity - distance between two vectors

Distance = 1 - cosine Similarity
cosine Similarity = cos@
