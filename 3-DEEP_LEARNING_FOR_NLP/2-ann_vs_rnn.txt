Can we solve sequential data with ANN..



Dataset {sentiment analysis}

    Text                 o/p

the food is good          1
the food is bad           0
the food is not good      0


ANN   : TEXTPROCESSING -> Text -> Vector 


Unique words -> food good bad not (vocabulary = 4)


Text to vector -> Bag of words

        food   good   bad   not

    s1   1      1      0     0
    s2   1      0      1     0
    s3   1      1      0     1

  * Have fixed vector size


The matrix is our inputs that we have to give it to Neural Network

- These are text data -> WHERE SEQUENCE IS IMPORTANT

But The inputs are not in sequence, (WE ARE LOOSING THE SEQUENCE)

Therefore, Meaning of the text is lost..






  * Whenever we work with text data, to get the sequence of information.
   It is good to give 1 word at a time.


   But in ANN We provide, multiple inputs..

   eg:

         food  good  bad  not

     s1   1    1     0    0


          I/p   Hidden layer   o/p

          1      
          1        o
          0        o           o    -- Y
          0        o
                S1,S2,S3


        So we have to Provide inputs based on TIME STAMP





        Thats Why we use  -> Simple RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
                               Data -> Sequential


        
         ANN -> I/P -> HIDDEN LAYER -> O/p


         RNN -> I/P -> Hidden layer  -> O/p
                           |    |
                           |____|
                           Feedback loop , It will send feedback to everyother node..




                
                the   food   is    good
                x11    x12   x13    x14


                At - time 1 -> x11
                        t2  -> x12
                        t3  -> x13
                        t4  -> x14
                   * One word at a time..
